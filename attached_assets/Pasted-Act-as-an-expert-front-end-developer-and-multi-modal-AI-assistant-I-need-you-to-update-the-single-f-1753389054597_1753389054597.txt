Act as an expert front-end developer and multi-modal AI assistant. I need you to update the single-file `index.html` website we previously created. Please implement the following four changes precisely.

**1. Change the Background Image**

* In the CSS within the `<style>` tag, find the rule for the `#home` section's background.
* Change the placeholder image file name from `background-image.jpg` to a new placeholder: **`tech-background.jpg`**.

---

**2. Update the Projects Section (`id="projects"`)**

* Replace the entire content of the project cards with the following detailed information.
* Each project card should contain the project name as a heading, the description as a paragraph, and a button linking to the provided URL.

* **Project 1:**
    * **Name:** `Movie-Success-Factor-Analysis`
    * **Description:** `An analysis of movie success factors using Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) on an IMDb dataset.`
    * **Link:** `https://github.com/AmbrishMuniraju/Movie-Success-Factor-Analysis`

* **Project 2:**
    * **Name:** `Customer-Review-Sentiment-Analysis`
    * **Description:** `An NLP project applying sentiment and emotion analysis to customer reviews using Python, TextBlob, and Scikit-learn's Logistic Regression model.`
    * **Link:** `https://github.com/AmbrishMuniraju/Customer-Review-Sentiment-Analysis`

* **Project 3:**
    * **Name:** `Insurance-Purchase-Prediction`
    * **Description:** `Predicting customer life insurance purchases using Python, Scikit-learn, and data visualization. Models include Logistic Regression and Random Forest.`
    * **Link:** `https://github.com/AmbrishMuniraju/Insurance-Purchase-Prediction`

* **Project 4:**
    * **Name:** `HR-Analytics-Dashboard`
    * **Description:** `An analytics dashboard investigating the key drivers of employee attrition, including job role, promotion history, and training participation.`
    * **Link:** `https://github.com/AmbrishMuniraju/HR-Analytics-Dashboard`

* **Project 5:**
    * **Name:** `Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Clustering`
    * **Description:** `Customer segmentation for an online gifts retailer using k-means clustering and RFM analysis in R to identify and profile distinct customer groups.`
    * **Link:** `https://github.com/AmbrishMuniraju/Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Clustering`

* **Project 6:**
    * **Name:** `AI-Enhanced Portfolio`
    * **Description:** `This is my personal portfolio website. I used Google's Gemini for creative prompts and content generation, Replit as the coding environment, and GitHub for hosting. This project showcases an efficient workflow that combines AI assistance with modern development and deployment tools.`
    * **Link:** `https://github.com/AmbrishMuniraju/Cursor-website`

**3. Modify Core Competencies Layout (`id="skills"`)**

* Update the CSS for the `#skills` section.
* Change the layout for the three sub-sections ("Analytical & Professional", "Technical Skills", "Programming & Software") from a multi-row grid or column layout to a **single horizontal row**.
* The lists under each subheading should remain neatly organized within their respective columns. Use Flexbox or a similar CSS technique to achieve this.

---

**4. Generate and Integrate Project Images**

* First, generate 6 professional, high-quality images, one for each project, based on the specific prompts below. The images should have a dark, modern, and tech-focused aesthetic to match the website.
* Second, integrate these newly generated images into their corresponding project cards in the `index.html` file. Use appropriate placeholder filenames in the `<img>` tags (e.g., `project-1-movie.jpg`, `project-2-sentiment.jpg`, etc.).

* **Image Prompts:**
    1.  **For "Movie-Success-Factor-Analysis":** `Generate a professional, abstract image with a cinematic feel. It should incorporate elements like film reels, glowing data charts (bar graphs, scatter plots), and subtle machine learning icons. Use a dark color palette with gold or blue highlights.`
    2.  **For "Customer-Review-Sentiment-Analysis":** `Create a conceptual image for an NLP project. Show abstract representations of text data transforming into sentiment icons (like positive/negative faces) and emotional color gradients. The style should be clean and digital.`
    3.  **For "Insurance-Purchase-Prediction":** `Generate an image symbolizing prediction and security. Combine elements like a protective shield, a rising stock chart, and abstract user profile icons. Use a professional and trustworthy color scheme like deep blue and white.`
    4.  **For "HR-Analytics-Dashboard":** `Create an image representing HR analytics. It should feature a clean dashboard interface with stylized charts (like org charts and donut charts) showing employee data and attrition rates. The aesthetic should be corporate and modern.`
    5.  **For "Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Clustering":** `Generate an image for a customer segmentation project. Show a central cluster of data points branching out into distinct, color-coded groups, representing different customer segments. The design should be minimalist and analytical.`
    6.  **For "AI-Enhanced Portfolio":** `Create an image that symbolizes the synergy between human creativity and AI. Depict a stylized human hand interacting with a glowing, abstract network of AI nodes or a digital brain. The image should represent collaboration and modern technology.`

Please now provide the updated, single `index.html` file with all these changes implemented.
