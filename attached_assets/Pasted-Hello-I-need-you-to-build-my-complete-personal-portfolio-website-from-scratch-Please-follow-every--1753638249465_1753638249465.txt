Hello! I need you to build my complete personal portfolio website from scratch. Please follow every instruction carefully to create the final version.

The final output must be a single index.html file. All CSS must be inside a <style> tag in the <head>, and all JavaScript must be inside a <script> tag before the closing </body> tag.

1. General Design & Core CSS

Theme: Modern, responsive, dark theme (e.g., background #121212, text #E0E0E0).

Navigation: A fixed navbar at the top with links that smooth-scroll to each section.

Crucial CSS Fixes:

Apply a CSS reset to prevent blank spaces around the page: html, body { margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 100%; }

Ensure the home section's background image always covers the full screen without distortion.

2. Final Section Order & Content

Please create the website sections in this specific order:

Section 1: Home (id="home")

Functionality: This section must fill the entire initial screen (height: 100vh).

Background: Use a full-screen background image. In the CSS, use the placeholder path tech-background.jpg. Ensure the CSS uses background-size: cover; and background-position: center;.

Content:

Main Heading (<h1>): Ambrish Muniraju

Tagline (<p>): Data Analyst / Business Analyst

Buttons: LinkedIn and GitHub buttons with your profile links.

Section 2: About Me (id="about")

Content:

Heading (<h2>): About Me

Paragraph (<p>): Use this exact text:

Section 4: Core Competencies (id="skills")

Layout: Display the three sub-sections ("Analytical & Professional", "Technical Skills", "Programming & Software") in a single horizontal row. The bulleted lists under them should remain in their respective columns.

Content: Use the lists of skills provided previously.

Section 5: My Professional AI Toolkit (id="toolkit")

Functionality:

Create a grid to display tool logos. For each category, initially show only the top 4 logos.

Below the top 4, add a "Show More" button.

On click, this button must use a smooth animation (e.g., animate max-height) to expand the section and reveal the remaining logos. The button text must change to "Show Less". Clicking again should reverse this.

Visuals: Use <img> tags for all logos. Logos must have a nice hover effect (e.g., scale up slightly).
