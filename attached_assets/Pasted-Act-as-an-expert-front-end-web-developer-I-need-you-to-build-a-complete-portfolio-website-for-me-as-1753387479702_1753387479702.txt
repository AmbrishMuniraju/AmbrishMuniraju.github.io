Act as an expert front-end web developer. I need you to build a complete portfolio website for me as a single `index.html` file. The final output must not have separate CSS or JS files.

**Crucially, all CSS must be placed within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section, and all JavaScript must be placed within a `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag.**

The website must be fully responsive, have a modern, minimalistic dark theme, and feature smooth scroll animations and professional hover effects.

Here is the detailed structure and content for the website:

**## 1. Overall Structure & Styling**

* **Layout**: A single, continuous-scrolling page.
* **Theme**: Dark theme. Use a background color like `#121212` and a light text color like `#E0E0E0`. Use a distinct accent color for links, buttons, and highlights.
* **Typography**: Use a modern, clean sans-serif font like 'Poppins' or 'Montserrat' from Google Fonts.
* **Navigation**: Create a fixed navigation bar at the top. The links (Home, About, Projects, Skills, Education, Contact) must scroll smoothly to the corresponding section.
* **Animations**: Implement subtle fade-in animations as the user scrolls to each new section. Interactive elements like buttons and project cards should have smooth hover effects.

**## 2. Page Sections**

Create the following sections in this specific order using semantic HTML tags.

---

### **Section 1: Home (`id="home"`)**

* **Background**: This section is the most important visually. It **must** use a full-screen background image. In the CSS, use the placeholder `background-image.jpg` as the file path. The image should be set to cover the entire area and have a semi-transparent dark overlay applied via CSS to ensure the white text on top is perfectly readable and stands out.
* **Content**:
    * Vertically and horizontally center the content.
    * Main heading (`<h1>`): "Ambrish Muniraju"
    * Subheading (`<p>`): "Aspiring AI Data Engineer / Data Analyst"
    * **Buttons**: A LinkedIn button linking to `https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambrishmuniraju/` and a GitHub button linking to `https://github.com/AmbrishMuniraju`. Use Font Awesome icons for the logos.

---

### **Section 2: About Me (`id="about"`)**

* **Layout**: A two-column layout (text on one side, image on the other).
* **Content**:
    * Heading (`<h2>`): "About Me"
    * Paragraph (`<p>`): "Dedicated and detail-oriented business analyst with a 2:1 Master's degree in Business Analysis from Queen's University Belfast. Proficient in data analysis, problem-solving, and translating complex insights into strategic actions. Passionate about using analytical expertise to drive business success and innovation. Actively seeking opportunities to contribute and grow in dynamic organizations."
* **Image**: In the second column, add an image using the placeholder `ai-data-image.jpg`. Style it to blend into the website's background using CSS `mix-blend-mode` or a similar technique.

---

### **Section 3: Projects (`id="projects"`)**

* **Heading (`<h2>`):** "My Projects"
* **Layout**: A responsive grid of project "cards".
* **Project Details**:
    * Create **5 project cards** with placeholder titles ("Project Title [1-5]"), a placeholder image (`project-1.jpg`, etc.), and a button linking to `https://github.com/AmbrishMuniraju`.
    * Create a **6th project card** with the title "Portfolio Website (Cursor & Gemini)" and a placeholder image (`project-6.jpg`). This card **must not** have a GitHub link button.

---

### **Section 4: Core Competencies (`id="skills"`)**

* **Heading (`<h2>`):** "Core Competencies"
* **Layout**: A three-column layout.
* **Content**:
    * **Column 1 (`<h3>`):** Analytical & Professional (List: "Data-Driven Decision Making", "Team Collaboration & Communication", "Effective Communication", "Time Management Skills", "Problem-Solving & Critical Thinking")
    * **Column 2 (`<h3>`):** Technical Skills (List: "Data Cleaning & Preprocessing", "Data Modeling & Pipelines", "Exploratory Data Analysis", "Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics", "Data Visualization & Storytelling", "Statistical Analysis")
    * **Column 3 (`<h3>`):** Programming & Software (List: "Languages: Python, R, SQL", "Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn", "Tools: Excel, KNIME, Tableau", "Version Control: Git, GitHub")

---

### **Section 5: Education (`id="education"`)**

* **Heading (`<h2>`):** "Education"
* **Content**:
    * **Entry 1**: `<h3>`MSc in Business Analytics`, `<p>`Queen's University Belfast`, `<p>`Graduated September 2024`
    * **Entry 2**: `<h3>`Bachelors in Commerce`, `<p>`Bangalore University`, `<p>`Graduated September 2022`

---

### **Section 6: Contact Me (`id="contact"`)**

* **Heading (`<h2>`):** "Get In Touch"
* **Content**: Display your email `ambrishmuniraju05@gmail.com` and add the LinkedIn and GitHub buttons again.

**## 3. Footer**

* Create a simple `<footer>` with the text: "Â© 2025 Ambrish Muniraju. All Rights Reserved."
